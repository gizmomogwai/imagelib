* Imagelib [[https://travis-ci.org/gizmomogwai/imagelib][https://travis-ci.org/gizmomogwai/imagelib.svg?branch=master]]

This is a little gem to support my photo workflow.

** Installation
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    gem install imagelib
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Usage

You just have to add a .imagelib file to your home which is a yaml file describing
where images can be found and what prefix images from these source should get.
example:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    -
      path: file:///Volumes/MyGoodCam
      prefix: hq_
    -
      path: file:///Volumes/MyLittleCam
      prefix: lq_
    -
      path: mtp://20194/DCIM/Camera
      prefix: my_mtp_phone_
#+END_EXAMPLE

this means that pictures that can be found in /Volumes/MyGoodCam are
copied to ~/Pictures/ImageLib with the prefix hq_ and pictures that
can be found in /Volumes/MyLittleCam are copied to ~/Pictures/ImageLib
with the prefix lq_. The library also supports mtp, there you use the
mtp id of your device and a path on the device to copy the images over.

After that you are ready to launch the executable

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    copy2lib
#+END_EXAMPLE
